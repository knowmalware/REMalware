# Triage

## About

The term triage comes from World War I when French doctors, overwhelmed with patients, had to decide which could survive given treatment, and which were lost. In incident resposne, analysts have to decide not only if an incident warrants attention, but what level of attention is needed. Responders may refer to malware analysis to make such decisions.

Triage tasks should be:

- Scriptable
- Consume minimal time and resources
- Logged
    - Consider a database for storage and retrieval of results


## Tasks

Common malware triage tasks include:

- File hashing (md5sum, sha1sum, ssdeep, sdhash)
- File type identification
- Packer/Compiler Identification (PEiD)
- Entropy Analysis (Mandiant Red Curtain, IDA Entropy plugin/tool)
- strings
- Signature/AV Scan
    - Clam AV
    - Yara
- PE Header Analysis
- Simple dynamic analysis
