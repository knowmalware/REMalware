Red Team tools have become popular with cyber adversary groups.  Sometimes a malware analyst needs to be able to identify when components of these tools were used and how to extract useful information from them.

Here we will focus on delivery and post-exploitation frameworks, specifically [Metasploit](https://docs.metasploit.com/), [CobaltStrike](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/), and [Sliver](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0633/).  Also worth mentioning are [Powershell Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire), [PoshC2](https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2), [BruteRatel](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/brute-ratel-c4-tool/), [ASyncRAT](https://github.com/NYAN-x-CAT/AsyncRAT-C-Sharp), [Covenant](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant), [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic), and [Nighthawk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/nighthawk-and-coming-pentest-tool-likely-gain-threat-actor-notice).


Metasploit Framework
====================

Metasploit is the oldest of these frameworks.  It was released as an opensource framework for red teams in 2003.  It has since become a popular tool since then, both by red teams and [real adversaries](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.meterpreter).

Metasploit Framework includes an exploit + payload packaging system, where the payload is often a form of the Meterpreter command-and-control capability.  While there are ways to detect the basic shellcode ([yara sig](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/blob/master/malware/RAT_Meterpreter_Reverse_Tcp.yar)), there are also ways to [encode](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/shikata-ga-nai-encoder-still-going-strong) and [package](https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads/) that shellcode.


CobaltStrike
============

Cobalt Strike [started as a GUI for Metasploit](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/a-history-of-cobalt-strike-in-training-courses/) with its release in 2012.  It has since developed into its own unique capability as a popular commercial threat emulation tools.  However, it retains the ability to deploy and use a meterpreter payload.

A couple of [config](https://github.com/Sentinel-One/CobaltStrikeParser) [parsers](https://github.com/strozfriedberg/cobaltstrike-config-extractor) exist for Cobalt Strike payloads.


Sliver
======

Sliver is an [open source project](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) first released in 2019.  It has been [observed used by an APT group](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sliver).
