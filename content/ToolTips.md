Strings
=======

Use *strings* command on Linux systems, or download the [sysinternals strings tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings).

To get all ASCII strings, just run the command and give it the file as its first argument:

```shell
strings malware_bin
```

If that produces too many strings to quickly review, then limit it to strings of length 8 or more:

```shell
strings -n 8 malware_bin
```

If on a Linux system, then also run the command to show UTF-16 little endian (aka widechar) strings:

```shell
$ strings -e l malware_bin
```


FLOSS
-----

To find strings that have been commonly obfuscated, use the [FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS)](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-floss).

```shell
$ floss malware_bin
```

To find just the decoded strings and create an IDAPython script to annotate them in IDA Pro:

```shell
$ floss -i ida_floss.py malware_bin
```
