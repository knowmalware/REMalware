# The Basics

## Where to Begin

IDA loads the address pointed to by `AddressOfEntryPoint` in the PE Headers. Where do we go from here?

1. What do I know about the application already?
    - Outputs
    - Inputs
    - Functionality
1. What am I looking for?
    - Strings (e.g. output, packet content)
    - Functionality (e.g. networking code)
    - Types of algorithms, e.g.
        - Encode/decode algorithms usually have *loops*
        - Command-processing algorithms usually have *nested conditionals* or *switch statements*
